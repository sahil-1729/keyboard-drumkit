# keyboard-drumkit
The Project keyboard-drumkit allows user to play the drum sounds, by pressing the keyboard keys from 'A' to 'L'.
This project helps in playing the drumkit, without having one.
The technologies used in this project are mostly front-end(HTML, Css, Js).
The reason I made this project, was to get more knowledge on DOM manipulation
