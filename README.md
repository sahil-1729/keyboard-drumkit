# keyboard-drumkit
The Project keyboard-drumkit allows user to play the sounds, by pressing the keyboard keys from 'A' to 'L'.
The technologies used in this project are mostly front-end(HTML, Css, Js).
The reason I made this project, was to get more knowledge on DOM manipulation.
### How to use the project
◾Press the specified letters on the keyboard to get the sounds                                             
❗ NOTE: Open this website on deskstop only, as it cannot take inputs from mobile device.
