# keyboard-drumkit
The Project keyboard-drumkit allows user to play the drum sounds, by pressing the keyboard keys from 'A' to 'L'.
This file helps in playing the drumkit, without even having a drumkit.
The technologies used in this project are mostly front-end(HTML, Css, Js).
The reason I made this project, was to get more knowledge on DOM manipulation
